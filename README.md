The `deunicode` library(aka. `unidecode`) transliterates Unicode strings such as "√Üneid" into pure
ASCII ones such as "AEneid."

This is an implementation of Rust's [deunicode](https://github.com/kornelski/deunicode) crate in Zig, using its own Unicode mapping data. Therefore, it is distributed under the same license.

## Examples

```zig
const std = @import("std");
const deunicode = @import("deunicode").deunicode;
const deunicodeAlloc = @import("deunicode").deunicodeAlloc;

pub fn main() !void {
    const allocator = std.heap.page_allocator;

    // Using allocator, caller should free the memory
    const res = try deunicodeAlloc(allocator, "‰∏ñÁïåÂíåÂπ≥");
    defer allocator.free(res);

    std.debug.print("{s}\n", .{res});  // Shi Jie He Ping

    // Using the buffer
    var buffer: [1024]u8 = undefined;
    const res2 = try deunicode(&buffer, "„Åä„ÅØ„Çà„ÅÜ");
    std.debug.print("{s}\n", .{res2});  // ohayou
}
```

## API Doc

- `fn deunicodeAlloc(allocator: Allocator, s: []const u8) ![]const u8`:  
  Return new string, caller should free memory.
- `fn deunicode(out: []u8, s: []const u8) ![]const u8`:  
  Use buffer instead of allocator. Retrun a string slice.

When an ASCII replacement cannot be found, the default placeholder `[?]` is used.
If you want to customize the placeholder, you can use the following API.

- `fn deunicodeCustomAlloc(allocator: Allocator, s: []const u8, custom_placeholder: []const u8) ![]const u8`
- `fn deunicodeCustom(out: []u8, s: []const u8, custom_placeholder: []const u8) ![]const u8`

## Installation

Add `deunicode` as dependency in `build.zig.zon`:

```
.{
    .name = "my-project",
    .version = "0.1.0",
    .dependencies = .{
       .deunicode = .{
           .url = "https://github.com/dying-will-bullet/deunicode/archive/refs/tags/v0.1.1.tar.gz",
           .hash = "1220fef06e2fab740b409eaec28fee459526c86f297e6c43fdaee471084cc569f397",
       },
    },
}
```

Expose `deunicode` as a module in `build.zig`:

```diff

## Guarantees and Warnings

Here are some guarantees you have when calling `deunicode()`:

- The `String` returned will be valid ASCII; the decimal representation of
  every `char` in the string will be between 0 and 127, inclusive.
- Every ASCII character (0x00 - 0x7F) is mapped to itself.
- All Unicode characters will translate to printable ASCII characters
  (`\n` or characters in the range 0x20 - 0x7E).

There are, however, some things you should keep in mind:

- Some transliterations do produce `\n` characters.
- Some Unicode characters transliterate to an empty string, either on purpose
  or because `deunicode` does not know about the character.
- Some Unicode characters are unknown and transliterate to `"[?]"`
  (or a custom placeholder, or `None` if you use a chars iterator).
- Many Unicode characters transliterate to multi-character strings. For
  example, "‰∏ñ" is transliterated as "Shi".
- Transliteration is context-free and not sophisticated enough to produce proper Chinese or Japanese.
  Han characters used in multiple languages are mapped to a single Mandarin pronounciation,
  and will be mostly illegible to Japanese readers. Transliteration can't
  handle cases where a single character has multiple possible pronounciations.
